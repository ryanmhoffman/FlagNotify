# FlagNotify
FlagNotify is a mobile app designed to give a notification when your flag is supposed to be 
at half staff. Many flag pole owners keep up on the big days like Memorial Day, 9/11, etc. 
but pay less attention to the lesser known days when the flag should be lowered.  

FlagNotify will let you know when your flag is supposed to be at half staff. It will give 
you alerts for national holidays, but also let you know state specific flag alerts so your 
flag is always at the correct height.
